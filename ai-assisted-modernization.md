# ðŸ§  Vision: AI-Assisted Legacy Code Modernization

## "Lift, Don't Replace" Philosophy

The core idea behind `code-relay` and `lewm-lint-runner` is not to throw out old code â€” it's to **understand it**, **respect it**, and **incrementally modernize it** using AI as a partner.

### Why This Matters

Most real-world systems aren't shiny new greenfield projects. They're built on:
- Legacy AngularJS apps
- Untyped TypeScript and JavaScript
- Code that works, but doesn't match today's best practices

And yet, these systems power real businesses, products, and platforms.

Modern tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot are **most powerful when used to uplift old code**, not erase it. By combining linting, intelligent refactoring, and semantic architectural awareness, we can evolve old systems into modern, maintainable software.

## The Stack We're Building

1. **Lint First** â€“ Surface technical debt with tools like `ng lint`
2. **Refactor With Insight** â€“ Use AI to rewrite, but with awareness of structure and flow
3. **Track and Undo** â€“ With `code-relay`, every change is tokenized, reversible, and traceable
4. **Enforce Patterns** â€“ With `lewm-lint-runner`, we build based on dependency-aware, domain-specific order
5. **Modernize Gradually** â€“ SOLID principles, clean layering, architectural separation â€” layered in, not forced in

## What This Is Really About

This is a philosophy for the real devs. The ones who:
- Inherit 8-year-old apps with janky build chains
- Want to improve, not destroy
- Need automation that respects what already exists

AI is powerful. But you are the architect.

Together, weâ€™re building a method of modernizing codebases **with memory, respect, and control**.
